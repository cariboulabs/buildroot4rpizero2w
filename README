# Alon
```
#so that things work...
unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH

# to customize the linux kernel
make linux-xconfig #or make linux-menuconfig
# copy generated output/build/linux-XYZ/.config to desired location

make raspberrypizero2w_defconfig
make menuconfig #if you want to make changes (like the linux kernel location)
make -j10 V=1 #this can take sometime

#note: there is also make busybox-menuconfig to configure busybox
```

## 

scripts that should be ran at startup:

`/board/raspberrypizero2w/rootfs_overlay/etc/init.d/S99ping_start.sh` 

the S99 is a naming convetion with which the kernel decides the order of tasks

##

after runing make, all outputs will be inside an `output` directory. Insert an sd card and ensure its mounted on sda

```
lsblk
```

burn it

```
sudo umount /dev/sda*
sudo dd if=output/images/sdcard.img of=/dev/sda bs=4M status=progress
sync
sudo eject /dev/sda
```

insert to rpi and you are ready to go

Buildroot is a simple, efficient and easy-to-use tool to generate embedded
Linux systems through cross-compilation.

The documentation can be found in docs/manual. You can generate a text
document with 'make manual-text' and read output/docs/manual/manual.text.
Online documentation can be found at http://buildroot.org/docs.html

To build and use the buildroot stuff, do the following:

1) run 'make menuconfig'
2) select the target architecture and the packages you wish to compile
3) run 'make'
4) wait while it compiles
5) find the kernel, bootloader, root filesystem, etc. in output/images

You do not need to be root to build or run buildroot.  Have fun!

Buildroot comes with a basic configuration for a number of boards. Run
'make list-defconfigs' to view the list of provided configurations.

Please feed suggestions, bug reports, insults, and bribes back to the
buildroot mailing list: buildroot@buildroot.org
You can also find us on #buildroot on OFTC IRC.
